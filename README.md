# NocoNetAttendanceApp
The networking society in Fort Collins called NocoNet has been using a google doc for sign ins which requires people to retype their information everytime they show up. This project will be a standalone app created in Electron.js where people can search themselves and populate the user fields based on the information stored in a JSON file.
